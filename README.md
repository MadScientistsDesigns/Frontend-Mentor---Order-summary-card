## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I learned that if you don't code in a year you forget even the basics, smh.

### Useful resources

- [Converting Colors](https://convertingcolors.com/) - This helped me convert colors into rgb because Atom and Emmet complained about hsl.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - I used W3 Schools to look up the code for both HTML and CSS properties that I didn't remember off the top of my head. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
